                    I started this journey ages ago , to be honest I should of
                    stayed on
                    the path I was on and not got caught up in a <a href="#">gambling
                        additicion.</a>
                    When I first discoverd web development I was looking at what
                    to
                    do
                    with the rest of my life,
                    Having sufferd from mental health issues for the majority of
                    my
                    teen's
                    and ealry twenties, to then being diagnosed with Borderline
                    perosnality disorder,
                    <a href="#" id="BPDlink"><em>BPD</em></a> After a rough
                    brekup,I
                    really struggled to come back to relaity and find passion
                    for
                    life,
                    love and everthing inbetween.

                <h2 id="mHead2">The journey so far!</h2>
                <p>I suppose we can start somewhere in my late teens, I was
                    attending
                    collage, a place called Cork institut of Technology.
                    latter renamed <a href="#" Id="MTU_LINK">Munster Technology
                        University</a> <img scr="#" alt="A picture of CIT/NMCI">
                    , at the time i was studdying marine engineering,
                    I found it tough,Mosly due to the fact that I just didnt put
                    any
                    real work into it at all, like at all, And it was a golden
                    opertunity that I
                    completely <span id="EM_words"><em> fucked up </em></span>.After
                    relaising that i was bound to fail, I just decided to get to
                    the
                    other end,
                    and repeat next year , My parents were not happy about this
                    considering how much work they had put into me to get up and
                    down to
                    the college everyday, <aside id="rents">I will get to my
                        parents
                        later</aside>

                    Having pleaded with them to let me repeat, I went back to do
                    a
                    few
                    subjects that i failed in, honestly though at this point,
                    I should of just dropped out ad not spent the next five
                    years
                    persuing a <span id="EM_words"><em> dream </em></span>.The
                    reason i
                    kept at it so long.. to be honest part of it was me wanting
                    to
                    impress my parents and the other half was the actual job i
                    could
                    get
                    at the end, and the money.

            <div id="P3">
                <p>
                    During this time of me chasing that <span id="EM_words"><em>
                            dream
                        </em></span>.
                    I worked multiple diffrent jobs, From selling suits,
                    installion
                    crews with mk, Door to Door sales, and call centers.
                    After multiple attemps at repeats of marine engineering i
                    dropped
                    out and switched over to nautical science.
                    Again just chasing the <span id="EM_words"><em> dream </em></span>
                    that i have had for so long, And also to keep my parents
                    happy(this
                    wasnt enfoced by them, it was always my choice but I really
                    didn't
                    want to let them down )

            <div id="P4">

                <p>Skipping ahead I did manage to pass the first year of

                    science at the disbelife of a few lectures<span id="NMCILT">If

                    had
                    to do
                    a placment onboard a sea going vessel,
                    <h5 id="ship_name">THE ARKLOW MANOR </h5><img src="#" alt="A

                    while serving on this vessel i leanrd a lot, but i also
                    discoverd
                    that life on a ship is tough.
                    I served my time and returnd home to await my next placemnt,
                    which
                    never happened. i droped out og the course, with the
                    intention
                    of going back but never did.

            </div>
            <div id="P5">

                <p>During this time I met an amazing woman whos name i'll keep
                    to
                    myself
                    , but thoese that know me know who she is.
                    She was and possibley still is an amazing,down to earth
                    ,beautiful
                    and kind person. The kind of person,who,
                    took me for all that i was and all that i was not.An amazing
                    free
                    spirt,had eyes and a mind that could look beyond the
                    physicalness of
                    a human, and see into the
                    parts of thier soul that needed healing or help and actual
                    help
                    them,and try to heal them.
                    althoght it didnt last long, if felt like an eternity in a
                    good
                    sense, she was my first true love,
                    how do i know this? you ask, beacuse when she left it broke
                    me
                    so
                    much that I litralley could even function.
                    also this is when I got diagnosed with <a href="#"

                    Not to dwell to much on the past, I have hope that she is
                    well,
                    HAppy and living her life to the absolute fullnes, that she

                <p>Well 27, Another year where i really didnt live up to my
                    potential, To be honest with myself;
                    I lacked something still dont know what but something, A
                    drive
                    so to speak,This year was either the first or second
                    time that i took over running of the MK warehouse (my dads
                    company here in ireland) <a
                        href="http://www.christmastown.ie"
                        id="MK_LINK">MK illumination Ireland</a> This was not
                    without its own set of problems, but i overcame and i
                    leanred
                    along the way. Nothing really massive to note here other
                    then it
                    was just another year for me.

                </p>

            <div id="P7">
                <p>
                    <h4>28-29</h4>
                    This is where things started to chnage, not for the good
                    either,
                    Covid hit, and i fell deeper into my gambling additicion
                    then i
                    could have ever imagined.

                    im sure i dont need to dive into Covid beause i think even
                    if
                    your reading this 50 to 100 years from now everbody will
                    know
                    about it still, Its probley ongoing,lol.

                    During these lockdowns i stared gambling online, and boy did
                    that go on for way to long, I lost thousands of euro, and i
                    kept
                    at it day in day out for almost two years straight.

                    Ill come back to that in a bit, i also started working <a
                        href="#">insent
                        link for zipit</a>in ZIP it
                    in farren woods during this time,
                    and overcame my fear of heights , I didnt mention that to
                    them
                    in the interview at the time, Having a head for heights was
                    kinda a requirment to work there.

                    I worked two seasons there,but something else was calling me
                    I
                    loved the work but my mind was always wanting to know
                    more,just
                    an appitie for more knowledge and to be honest i wasnt being
                    thought what i wanted to know.

                    Still though thinking honeslty , I was still immaurture in a
                    lot
                    of senses.

                    Each winter i would go back working with Mk , Where my brain
                    was
                    allowed to fucntion at its highest level,- Chaos was and is
                    the
                    way my brain has functioned for so long, well orginized
                    chaos.
                    and that matches mk perfectly.

                    Im rambling here, but just trying to catch up myself and the
                    reader about who i am, and
                    I will more then likey put a little question box somewhere
                    on
                    the page where you can send me questions if youd like to
                    know
                    more about me,

                    Im an open book,ask away!
